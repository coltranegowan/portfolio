      <h2>Proposition: Use-of-force complaints have disproportionately targeted younger individuals.</h2>

        <h3>FOR the Proposition</h3>

        <figure>
          <img src="pro_vis.png" alt="Younger New Yorkers Suffer More Excessive Force Violations", width="1000px" />
          <figcaption>The distribution of excessive force complaints in New York City is skewed towards younger citizens, 
            especially towards those in the 18-24 age range.
          </figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>Design Decisions and Rationale:</p>

        <ul>
          <li><h4>Bin Sizes: -1.5</h4>
            <p>My choice to make the bins different sizes was made to exaggerate the already present trend of excessive force 
            complaints being higher for complainants under 30. Originally I had uniform bin sizes which did show this trend to
            an extent, but I decided that making the bins for older ages shorter would make it seem like age was even more of a
            factor in this data. I think the very obvious negative correlation after the 18-24 bin makes it veyr obvious to the reader
            of this trend, leaving less room for doubt on smaller details such as the sixe of the bins, since the width of the bars 
            are all the same.</p>
          </li>
          <li><h4>Color Choices: -1</h4>
            <p>I used 'px.colors.sequential.Reds[::-1]' to create an effect in this graph where the bars got less red as the ages got larger, 
            which was another way to coaxe the reader into the outcome that I wanted them to get from this visualization. The darker red on the left 
            corresponding to younger ages denotes a feeling of more dense, more important data and draws eyes to itself. When a reader's eyes are 
            drawn here, the color plus the height of the bar will make it very easy to draw the conclusion that younger people are more effected 
            by these complaints. The red also draws parallels to blood and violence, which can bring in an empathetic element when talking about 
            violent complaints.</p>
          </li><h4>Title: -1.5</h4>
          <p>One of the main parts of a visualization is the title, and this one invokes even more emotions in the reader. Word choices like 
          'suffer' helps summon more negative emotions before one even looks at the graph, and a good title can have someone making up their 
          mind before even processing the visualization. My word choice of 'Violations' instead of 'Complaints' also helps this data seem more 
          like actual wrongdoing that occured instead of just a complaint by a citizen.</p>
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>AGAINST the Proposition</h3>

        <figure>
          <img src="against_vis.png" alt="The Kids That Cried Wolf: Younger People in New York File More Police Complaints", width="1100px"/>
          <figcaption>This visualization shows clearly how younger people, especially those 18-24, in New York City file many more complaints than any other age 
            group.
          </figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>Design Decisions and Rationale:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            <h4>Color Choice: -1</h4>
            <p>The color palette used here again leverages a reversed red scale (px.colors.sequential.Reds[::-1]), where younger age groups 
              are assigned darker reds, and older ones get lighter shades. While this isn’t inherently misleading, it visually links youth with 
              urgency and intensity. In the context of police complaints, red evokes notions of danger or wrongdoing, subtly guiding viewers to 
              focus on the youth. I considered using a neutral or diverging palette (e.g., blues or grays), but the red scale makes the disparity 
              between groups feel more alarming, even when the counts may not be extremely far apart. This subtly pushes a more emotionally charged 
              narrative.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li><h4>Title: -1.5</h4>
            <p>The title “The Kids That Cried Wolf: Younger People in New York File More Police Complaints” heavily frames the data with a 
              critical lens. It evokes a well-known moral fable associated with dishonesty and overreaction, implying that these complaints may 
              lack validity. While the data does show more complaints by younger people, the framing undermines their legitimacy and credibility. 
              I chose this phrasing to intentionally provoke skepticism in the reader. A more neutral alternative could have been “Police 
              Complaint Volume by Age Group,” but I opted for this in order to suggest over-reporting in youth, setting up bias before data is 
              even read. I also used misleading bin titles but labeling the first bin 18-24, when that bin includes all ages 0-24. By doing this, 
              I made that bin seem even smaller and more important.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li><h4>Scaling Values (Exaggeration): -2</h4>
            <p>The most overtly deceptive choice was applying a power transform (scaled_count = complaint_count ** 1.5) to the y-values. 
              This decision artificially inflates the height differences between age groups, making it seem as if the 18–24 group files 
              exponentially more complaints than others. I chose this to visually overemphasize a real trend—yes, younger groups file more 
              complaints, but this transform makes it look extreme. Linear scaling showed less dramatic differences. While it persuades more 
              effectively, it crosses the line into misleading territory since no axis annotation hints at non-linearity.

        <h2>Final Reflection</h2>

        <p>Creating both visualizations challenged me to think deeper about how data design influences perception. For the persuasive side, 
          it was relatively straightforward to guide interpretation by making earnest design choices, like emphasizing trends through clear binning 
          or using emotionally charged color schemes and titles. These choices leaned into the data’s natural story while still maintaining its 
          integrity. On the other hand, designing the deceptive visualization required more intentional manipulation. I had to consciously push 
          boundaries by exaggerating scaling, skewing color emphasis, and crafting a provocative title that cast doubt on the validity of the 
          complaints.
          <br>
          <br>
          This project reshaped my understanding of what ethical data visualization entails. Ethical analysis is not just about showing the 
          “truth” but doing so in a way that avoids distorting the viewer’s interpretation through visual tricks. It means preserving proportional 
          relationships, labeling clearly, and resisting the urge to editorialize with misleading framing or exaggerated encodings. While 
          persuasion can be acceptable—especially in advocacy or storytelling—there is a line where it turns into manipulation. That line is 
          crossed when design choices intentionally obscure the data’s real structure, provoke unearned emotional reactions, or imply conclusions 
          that the data does not support. From this experience, I see how ethical visualization is a balancing act between narrative clarity and 
          visual honesty.</p>
